\chapter*{Acknowledgement}

First of all, I would like to thank God for all the blessings in my life. Then, my family for their unconditional love for me. I am indebted to them for their efforts in my upbringing and providing me with good education.

Then I would like to thank my thesis supervisor Prof. Dr. Alexander Gepperth. Taking the course of Machine Learning with him has helped me a lot in understanding the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning. Later, he supported me throughout the period of research and writing this thesis. His guidance on weekly meeting has allowed me to successfully complete this piece of work.

At last, I am grateful to Saira for being a constant source of encouragement in my life and Vaaceph, Wajahat and Saeed for their true friendship. They have surely made my university life more enjoyable.

I am proud to have all these people in my life. Thank you.
