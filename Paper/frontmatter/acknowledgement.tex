\chapter*{Acknowledgement}

I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Prof. Dr. Alexander Gepperth. The door to Prof. Gepperth office was always open whenever I had a question about my research or writing. He guided me on this field from scratch and steered me in the right direction whenever he thought I needed it.
\newline
\newline
I would also like to thank the experts who were involved in this research project: Jan-Frederic Stienke and Lutz Petrean. Without their passionate participation and continuous support, I would never have successfully completed this thesis.
\newline
\newline
Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to God and then my parents for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. 
\newline
\newline
Thank you.
