\chapter*{Abstract}
This paper investigates the feasibility of classifying lanes in a traffic scene using images from a computer simulation. The simulation is developed on top of a renowned gaming engine, known as Unity3D, through which images are captured from a camera mounted on a car on a multi-lane road. RGB features along with gradients have been used as feature vectors. A popular Convolutional Neural Network known as LeNet-5 is tweaked according to input images and trained using the extracted features to classify the region of interest into their respective categories. Our model takes in traffic scene image and a point coordinate as inputs and predicts the lane on which point exists. We have achieved a very good classification accuracy of 98\%. However, we need to research more after incorporating complex scenarios with realistic objects, lighting conditions and shadows in our simulation to cover all the situations and to make it usable in real-world.

% Different training schemes and their effect on the classification rate are also discussed along with the possibility of developing an automated winter road surface classification system in future.
